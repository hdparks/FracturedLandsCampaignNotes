- City of Tieflings
- Gideon has only heard, uh, stories

- Teleported there by [[Alanator]] in [[Daily Notes/2024/Sep/19 (Thu).md]] 
- This far east, trees are thick-barked and grass is scarce. Hellgate though is the [[Ravna]] of this land: not quite the *city of flowers*, but close to it
- Something about the gate to hell keeps the rifts away. Safe farming, herding, ect.
- Lots of stonework. Makes sense, no trees
- Keep is the largest building in town. Castle-style keep.
- Rest of the town is 1-2 story buildings. A tavern, a blacksmith house.
- Aqueduct was built from a nearby lake.
- A mason's guild is hosted here in Hellgate to maintain the aquaduct as well as the stonework
- Tieflings make up a bulk of the population -- even more than humans
