- Cold open: over 3000 years ago

- Thalrick, preacher, prepares to give weekly sermon
- Protection of Tyr, righteousness
- Prompted to preach against Augma and the House of knowledge
- "Lies", a mysterious stranger interjects

- We leave the adventurer's tavern into the wilderness. We begin climbing the steep side of the ridged mountains
- After a day of travel, we break through the pass enough to see the Fractured Lands
    - We see rifts snap open and closed as storms gather and ozone fills the valley

- [[Gor]] warns us: "if a rift starts to break, just run"
- [[Daltus Vyer]] and [[Virsaviya Vyer]] are [[Addie]]'s parents, and [[Zyden Vyer]] her brother. All adventurers!
- We made it to the caravan behind the [[Runestone's Revenge]]. We meet with [[Allie]] underbutler 

Runestone's Revenge:
[[Han Silverblood]] - human fighter
[[Alanator the Wizened]] - human wizard
[[Marielle Nighthawk]] - halfling female riding a mastif
[[Esme Goldleaf]] - elf

- Alanator casts legend lore on the ruins and we see the last half of the cold-open: a big ol' explosion of prophecy, but not in a language we know
some other devils:
- [[Abadon, the Destroyer]]
- [[Malathor]]
- [[Opulentus]]
- [[Zeelus]]
- [[Maa dael, the Deceiver]]
