- Beyond the [[Ringwall Mountains]], down into the [[Fractured Lands]]
- Met with [[Runestone's Revenge]]. Half of them died. The rest have disbanded.
- We decided to search for answers about the king-killers in the Dwarven lands under the earth.
- We were teleported to [[Hellgate]] by [[Alanator]] the wizard of [[Runestone's Revenge]]

- Library, we learn [[Abadon, the Destroyer]], [[Vorax, The Devourer]], [[Malachor, the Cruel]], and [[Dimite, The Consort of Hate]] all seem to be chill with working with one another
- Similar [[Maa dael, the Deceiver]], [[Zeelis]], and [[Amaratia]] on the other team. Teams clash

- [[Exaltor, The Prideful]] and [[Opulentus, the Greedy]] are just out for themselves
