- The Tavern fight went well enough for us
- We talked to the [[Broker of Chaumont]], they told us that [[Rossk]] was behind the bounty
- [[Broker]] will remove the bounty if we publicly expose [[Rossk]]
- [[Rossk]] is working with someone from the Summersong Isles

- We head to pick up our reward from [[Rossk]], who comes out with [[Elroy]], the court wizard.
- Elroy immediately puts us to sleep, lol, except for Lily who cannot be put to sleep (elves!)
- We are manacled and taken to the dungeon while [[Rossk]] asks [[Lily Penrose|Lily]] to drop the [[Jim]] disguise
- [[Rossk]] told [[Lily Penrose|Lily]] to drop the [[Jim]] disguise
- They have a talk. Rossk doesn't regret what he did, but he also had nothing to do with the mind-altering stuff to make everyone forget Lily. That's weird...
- We are let out of the dungeon, and [[Lily Penrose|Lily]] gathers her things and joins us
- As we exit, [[Rossk]] is there confronting a younger human man with short, dark, curly hair. Very fine clothes
- Young guest tries to stop us from leaving
- Young guest dimension doored out into the courtyard, popped a rift with a clone of [[Rossk]], and disappeared
- The rift dropped out a Barlgura and a small army of Imps
- [[Elroy]] took care of the Imps while we killed the Barlgura

## Quest:
- [ ] Discover who [[Rossk]]'s partner is from the Summersong Isles
