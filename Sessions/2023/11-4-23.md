	- He asked for a battle report
	- Gideon told him everything about the fight with the Barlgura (except the Bane spell, that's not supposed to be allowed lol)
	- Gideon told him about the shady man talking to Rossk, and that he might be from the Summersong Isles
- Rossk disappeared last night. His guards were killed.
- Elroy has taken control for the time being
- Rossk had Elroy's family, somehow?? 
- Had been meeting with a suspicious noble several times, only once before the death of the king
- Rossk gave Elroy a strange vial, and told Elroy to reproduce 150 vials a day: modify memory spell in a bottle
- Lots of civil unrest going on right now in the streets. Over half have been affected by this modify memory spell
- Elves of Sylfrena ([[Lily Penrose|Lily]]'s family) not happy about any of it. Imperium of man is even more concerned
- Elroy has a dissected [[Cuthric]] on the table.
- Elroy also had a magical violin-like instrument he picked up from a group of adventurers over 8 years ago
- Addie immediately attunes to it and is able to play it

- On our way out of town, Gideon sent 78gp to his Nana via a Three Eyed Raven
