- Jovon makes his way toward us
- We follow him back out of the maze of the hold
- We enter the captain's cabin
- Reed says "There's been a murder"
- The captain helps us search the hold
- We find a goblin stowaway hiding in a section of old cargo
- [[Scram the Goblin]] told us that they saw a shapeshifter lure down the two dead men
- We search high and low, including rounding up the crew for a divine sense + detect magic: nothing
