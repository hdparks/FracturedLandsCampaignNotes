[[Myrstone]]
- News board talks about [[Chaumont]], [[Elroy]], and the rising civil unrest after [[Rossk]]'s plot
- "Smoke Rises in the East", there's a new warlord "always encased in black"
- We meet at O'Malley's pub
- Harry, the owner/bartender knows Addie
- "Kyden isn't here yet. Go ahead up to your table, I'll be right behind you."
- Kyden is super cool!
- He's been trying to get into the thieves guild, several gangs, trying to find a secret evil bad guy group. Something called "The Veleno", a nasty group of assassins for hire
- Criminal side of the city seems suspiciously clean, nobody messing with devils
- Someone is called "The Devil Under Myrstone"

- After everyone goes to bed, Addie goes back to work---AT THE CASTLE!!!!
- She enters through the servant entrance
- Talani, another servant, is super bubbly, glad to see her
- Vivena, the princess, patiently listens to Addie tell her all about a made up "vacation" until Talani finishes and leaves. Once Talani leaves, Vivena drops some of the foramlity and asks "okay, now what really happened"
- Vivena has had more of the same dark dreams. 
- Addie tells everything so far
- Vivena asks more about the supposed noble from the Summersong Isles causing trouble in Chaumont, trying to figure out who it might be. She comes up with a plan: Throw a party, invite everyone, and just have Addie look
- Addie has a dream of a single blocky light in a long dark tunnel. The tunnel warps and churns--it is alive.
- Gideon has a dream of looking up at spectral hands behind a wall as reality flips and changes, like the letter boards of a Grand Central Station.
