- (Gideon's coin flip went badly this morning)
- While auditing the College of Myrstone classes, Gideon hears about "votes" and "stotes", some sort of magical power source filled with strong energy
- Stotes are the perfect power source from automatons. (Stotes are the glowing thing)
- [[Vivenna]] comes to meet the party, dressed as [[Vivenna|Charlotte]]
- [[Kyden]] found a lead on [[The Devil Under Myrstone]]. We just need to do a quick fetch quest for someone. We need to talk to [[Iyomhar]] at the docks
- Next day (Gideon flipped well)
- We are to take a crate to the delta town of Mossydock. Upriver, we will meet at the base of the mountain.
