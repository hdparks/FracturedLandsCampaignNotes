- [[Faede Family Fund]] Gideon sends 650 from [[Myrstone]]
	- All his cash from the contract with the [[Devil under Myrstone]], plus other cash he had on hand.
- There is a festival coming up in [[Myrstone]] that revolves around the catamaran races.
	- During the catamaran race, they have fish spears -- winning without fish is worse than losing it all. Not officially, but you would be shamed
- Grand party; [[Devil under Myrstone]] is going to sneak us in so that we can figure out who our culprit is (the cultists responsible for the [[Ravna]] incident)
- Not at the palace, but still very lavish venue near the castle. We are there as Lily's bodyguards, and Lily is pretending to be a rich merchant
- Tyros - the performer from Ravna, was invited and recognizes us
- Lord Castellanas, owns metal mines on the mainland. Our main suspect, came in all illusion magic.
