- God Emperor has forgotten names, making him tired and angry
- Lots of demonic presence, looks like summoning by cultists
- a name comes up: Consort of Hate

- As the Abjurer and Druid are fighting the fiend from last week, we splooosh into the sea and are each granted a vision
- Reed: His sword starts talking to him more
- Lily: Burning, bleeding world tree 
- Addie: Young wizard looking through old wizard library, saying "hmm, looks like this guy learned instruments late in life as well.... what's up with that?"
- Gideon: Same library(?), dusty, wizard is a rotten corpse, looks at Gideon and says
	- "Secrets hidden, secrets not meant to be found"
	- "And so it is that Ash seeketh Embers"

- The book we stole is pretty freaking evil, and could probably grant someone warlock powers.

- The abjurer [[Logan]] and druid [[Renna]] help us kill the fiery demon dog. The abjurer follows our story back to the penthouse, but doesn't like what he finds and asks us to come see what happened.
- Inside, it's a grizzly scene. Servants and guards -- as well as Lord Castallanas -- are all lying on the ground dead. 11 total. No struggle. Look like they were arranged. Next to Castallanas, written in blood, in Infernal, "My servants will not fail me. Blood for blood."
