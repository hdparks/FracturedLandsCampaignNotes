- Recap, from a session I missed:
	- We did a job for the [[Devil under Myrstone]]
	- There was a fight with a Froghemoth, some raptors, and a croc-boar
	- [[Yub-Yub]], our guide, led us there and back
	- We traded some goods with some Dragonborn (the first time we had seen)
- That night, we camped again on the bank of the river before we got back to the coast
- We met the [[Devil under Myrstone]], he wants to be the _only_ devil under Myrstone.
- We tried to leave, but some of Reed's childhood friends stopped us:
	- Turns out [[Reed]] was born a human! In the Imperium, no less!
