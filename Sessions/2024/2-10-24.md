At the palace. 2 teams: 1 will stay here, 1 will take control of the Castellanas estate.
We are going with the away team! Onward to [[Chesterfield]]

[[Honor Duvalle]]'s rundown:
- 5 locations
	- The Estate (mansion + gardens, lands)
	- Copper Mine 1
	- Copper Mine 2
	- Silver Mine
	- Quarry

We'll be going to the estate, where there are most likely be the most evidence. Duvalle is going there as well. For now, heading there under the pretense of protection because [[Lord Castellanas]] has been "murdered".

The silver and one of the copper mines are further inland. Mining towns have formed around it.
Beth (copper) and Scallots (silver) mining towns.

We get to [[Chesterfield]] in the wee hours of the morning, the soldiers gather and head out toward their assigned locations.

[[Honor Duvalle]], another captain, and 20 guards and all of us head to the Castellanas estate on  wagons from the Chesterfield guard.

Some of the estate guards protest at first when we get there, but duvalle way outranks him and we are let in.

Duvalle's troops begin securing the grounds.

Castellanas' wife and 2 teenage kids are still living at the estate, and she demands an explanation

From ledgers in Castellanas' home office, [[Lily Penrose|Lily]] realizes that the ledgers in [[Myrstone]] reference a hidden 5th mine.

[[DUNWICH]]. We get to the ruins the next morning. Stone floors and bits of walls are the only remnants, and the jungle is reclaiming the land. Duvalle and his men poke through some of the buildings. We go to check out the platform.

The main platform takes up the center of the town. It's huge, 60ft. diameter. We found nothing on the platform though

In the bottom of the church in the town, we found a stairway to the crypt below. Instead of a crypt, we found [[Dunwich secret base]]. On the entry door, a metal skull glows with infernal runes: "Welcome, friends of the Deceiver. Speak the word and enter"

We try for a few minutes, but then Addie eventually casts knock and we get in. First room on the right is a study area with books and notes. First room on the left has... a bad smell coming from it. It's a torture chamber. There's definitely some bad stuff going on in there.

Figure in the ritual room on the next floor down. Long, dark brown hair, no facial hair, wearing a 4-horned skull-like mask and cultist robes. His sword is drawn, somewhere between scimitar and rapier. Same necklace pendant that Castellanas had. Standing behind a pedestal with a book on it.

Other cultists are there as well, only in red robes and in less armor.
