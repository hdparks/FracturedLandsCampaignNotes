- inside the temple in the hell dimension
- we tell [[Logan]] about the [[The Honor of Kings|Call of Honor]] and its significance
- [[Lily Penrose|Lily]] said something about "we don't know which royal line the Call of Honor supposedly came down from"
- Something about the talismans are important, both warlocks of the deceiver that we've fought (Castellanas and his son). Allows the wearers to teleport to one another at will.
- Gideon was right! Honor Guard tradition meant that the [[The Honor of Kings|Call of Honor]] actually is the thing that was passed down... to our own [[Honor Duvalle]]!
- In the crypt of the temple, we see a large group of cultists all chanting. The pope of the temple, Humphers, is the head of the cult it seems! Evil the whole time!
- They thank us for bringing Honor Duvalle into the temple, and the battle begins
- AWESOME fight!
- After the fight, the [[Astartes]] came in to assess the scene
- The King is dead!!
