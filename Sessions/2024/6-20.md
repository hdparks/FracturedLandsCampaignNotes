- We are on the road with [[Tyros]]
- That night, [[Reed]] has a nightmare - A horned woman humms as she smashes the heads of a room full of bound and gagged victims. Reed is also there, bound and gagged. He watches, helpless, as the monster chides him "Maybe you should have made a better choice" and smashes his mother's head in front of him. She then smashed the rest of the party before Reed snapped wide awake with his brands burning like brand new.
- We fought a necrotic owlbear; strange magic is afoot
- At the tavern, Gideon has a big fan. He has an old report of Gideon's from college, and wants an autograph. SUPER giddy, kinda creepy. Eventually Gideon gave his autograph. OOC I said "is this some sort of fae trap?". The guy leans in, still giddy and laughing, and whispers "you are getting too close" and leaves. CREEPY
